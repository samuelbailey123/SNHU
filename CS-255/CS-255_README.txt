Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

#The driverpass project was a small to midsize company that needed a application of some sort could work as somewhat of an active directory for all of their students amongst other things it can do. 

What did you do particularly well?

#Particularly creating all of the different diagrams that showed the different ways that the application is going to function. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

#I'd revise the diagram that shows the flow of the data. I would add more things like monitoring and other checks. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

#Truthfully the user is the only reason for the design. If a client is paying for something they are the only concern. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

#Designing software if done correctly is moderately easy. The software usually has a design to go off of and we also have the diagrams showing us even down to the detail of the functions and methods. If done this way the software is not that difficult to create.
