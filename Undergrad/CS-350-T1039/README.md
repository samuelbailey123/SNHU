Week 8 Journal

Throughout this course we worked on a TI embedded system. This course taught us best practices for coding on an embedded system. Particularly I was able to manupulate multiple LED's on the system as well as use the on board sensors to read data into the console. Some of the problem solving skills I was able to use on these projects will be able to translate into future projects in my career.
