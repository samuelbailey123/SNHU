Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

#The requirements of the app to be built was multiple screens with logic and buttons on each screen. It also needs to have an SQLite database with it. The app also has a login screen and a user base kept in the database. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

#One of the main designs was a login page for the users to login to their data. To keep the users in mind we try to have simplistic looking buttons for them to use as well as give them options to sign in with other apps. Things like google Facebook or apple sign in. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

#The process of build an app itself is always going to be based around the user client and their needs. The design all the way to the code was made for the users needs. The strategy was to start with a design then build a layout of how the code is going to function based on the design. After that we can get to work coding it. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

#In android studio using Kotlin when we build a new project it gives us some base tests that we can use to check our logic in our methods. Kotlin also has an extended library of testing tools that we can use as well as android studio. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

#Most of the innovation came from designing the app. Learning XML and creating the style sheets to have a layout. 

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

#After all of the work I'd say that the most success I had with the app was in the layout of it. Not only did I have to learn XML and create a layout but I also had to write the logic to the buttons under the layout which became a struggle considering my lack of experience.
